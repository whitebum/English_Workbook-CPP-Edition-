Make hay while the sun shines.
Men and melons are hard to know.
Necessity is the mother of invention
Never put off till tomorrow what can be done today.
None but the brave deserve the fair
No news is good news
No pains, No gains
Nothing ventured, Nothing gained.
Out of sight, Out of mind.
Practice makes perfect.
Rome was not built in a day.
Seeing is believing.
Slow and steady wins the race.
Spare the rod, and spoil the child.
Strike while the iron is hot.
Talk of the devil and he whill appear.
The early bird catches the worm.
The good pills are bitter to swallow.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
The pot calls the kettle black.
